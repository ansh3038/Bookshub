        <h2><b>The Race of My Life : An Autobiography</b></h2>
        <p> The Race of My Life documents the journey of an impoverished refugee who rose to become one of the most towering figures in Indian sports.</p>
        <p>In this remarkably candid autobiography, Milkha Singh shares the amazing highs of winning India's first ever gold in athletics at the Commonwealth Games, the unbridled joy of being hailed as the 'Flying Sikh' in Pakistan. Arguably, India s best male athlete, he received the Padma Shri at the height of his career in 1958. Although he stopped participating in competitive events in the early 1960s, he has dedicated his life to sports. He retired as Director of Sports and Youth Programme, Punjab Government, in 1991.
