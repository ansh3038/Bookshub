            <p>While physicist Sir Isaac Newton is widely viewed as the leading authority on gravity and motion, economist Benjamin Graham,
                best known for his book The Intelligent Investor, is lauded as a top guru of finance and investment. Known as the father of value investing,
                The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing is considered one of the most important books on the topic.
                By evaluating companies with surgical precision, Graham excelled at making money in the stock market without taking big risks.
                One of Graham's key contributions was to point out the irrationality and group-think that was often rampant in the stock market.
                Thus, according to Graham, investors should always aim to profit from the whims of the stock market, rather than participate in it.
                His principles of investing safely and successfully continue to influence investors today.
